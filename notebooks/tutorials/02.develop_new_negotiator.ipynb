    "Looking carefully at the 2D representation of the negotiation above, we can immediately see the issue: uninformed concession. Consider the buyer agent. It started with offering the best outcome for itself (The green offers above) and repeated it for a while (as expected) then started conceding (i.e. offering outcomes with lower utility for itself. Nevertheless, when it did conceed, it did not consider its partner at all. The figure below shows the same figure focusing on one specific choice the buyer did:\n",

    "The problem is highlighted in orange. Even though the buyer had several offers that are *of the same utility for itself*, they are not of the same utility *to its partner*. In the figure, it is clear that the buyer, chose the offer that was in fact the *worst* for its opponent. Choosing any other offer in the orange rectangle could have been better as it is nearer to the pareto-front. By offering this way, the partners are *leaving money on the table*. \n",

In our example, all outcomes are numeric but is it really meaningful to treat one day on the delivery issue as equal to one item as equal to one dollar? What can we do to avoid that? We can approximate distance over these issues by either matching (0) or mismatching (1). Moreover, we can consider the average matching score for all of the partner's offers so far instead of only the first one. Try to implement that. You will need to access the Negotiator-Mechanism-Interface (NMI) to get the negotiation issues using: `self.nmi.outcome_space`.\n",
    "2. Our aspiration mixin assumes that the minimum value for aspiration is the reserved value instead of zero which does not match the way we use it in `propose()`. In our case, reserved values *were* zero so this had no effect. In a general negotiation though, the reserved value should be taken into account.\n",
